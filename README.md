# Geometry-preserving Adaptive MeshER
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/122682242.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/122682242)

GAMer is a surface mesh improvement library developed to condition surface meshes derived from noisy biological imaging data.
Using Tetgen, GAMer can generate tetrahedral meshes suitable for finite elements simulations of reaction-diffusion systems among others.
Currently this version of GAMer is available only as a library, Blender addon, and python module.
In the future, we will reintroduce CLI programs for mesh processing.

## Installing
Prebuilt binaries of the GAMer Blender-addon are available under [releases](https://github.com/ctlee/gamer/releases).
Download the corresponding `.zip` for your platform and follow Blender's instructions to [install from file](https://docs.blender.org/manual/fi/dev/preferences/addons.html#header).

### Prerequisites
To build the GAMer library you will need access to a working C++ compiler with full C++14 support.
<!-- If you wish to use build and use the GAMer Python extensions, you will also need [SWIG > 3.0](http://www.swig.org/), access to a python intepreter, and the corresponding python shared library (`python.so` or `python.dylib`). -->
In order to use the GAMer Blender addon you should also have a working installation of Blender.

## External libraries bundled/downloaded with/by GAMer
* GAMer uses [Tetgen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/) to generate
tetrahedralizations.

* GAMer uses [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) to
compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the Local Structure Tensor.

* GAMer uses [casc](https://github.com/ctlee/casc) as the underlying simplicial
complex data structure.

* GAMer uses [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) to handle testing.

* GAMer uses Pybind11...

* Mesh checks in the GAMer Blender addon are inspired or borrowed from 3D Print Toolbox by Campbell Barton and Meshalyzer from CellBlender.

* [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) is also bundled with GAMer but not currently used.
